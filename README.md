# WifiPasswordScrapper

Thank you for being here :)
This is a simple Python code that prints all the saved wifi password in your windows system.
You can run this program to find out saved passwords in your friend's device and use his/her wifi   xP

I used subprocess module to track output, and took help from www.geeksforgeeks.com & www.docs.python.org to learn about Subprocess module.

I will upload video on my Youtube channel with detailed explanation of every line.

Happy Hacking!
